    "The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) - [Daily dataset](http://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/all-records/catalog/search/resource/details.page?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861) integrates daily climate observations from approximately 30 different data sources. Over 25,000 worldwide weather stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks."

    "This notebook provides two approaches in the creation of human readable datasets for historical daily temperature analytics. This analytical notebook is a component of a package of notebooks. The tasks addressed herein focused on data munging activities to produce a desired set of datasets for several predefined schemas. These datasets can now be used in other package notebooks for data exploration activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has embraced the concepts of reproducible research and can be shared with others so that they can recreate the data locally."
